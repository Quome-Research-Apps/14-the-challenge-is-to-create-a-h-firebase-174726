# **App Name**: Correlator

## Core Features:

- Data Import: Allow users to import two distinct time-series datasets (e.g., CSV, JSON) from local storage.
- Data Alignment: Synchronize the datasets by timestamp to prepare them for comparison. Impute missing values where appropriate.
- Correlation Analysis: Perform statistical correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) between the two datasets to quantify the relationship. Leverage an LLM tool to pick an appropriate method of statistical correlation to use depending on the shape and nature of the data.
- Visualization: Generate interactive visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs) to represent the correlation between the datasets. Allow users to customize the visualization (axes, colors, labels).
- Insight Summary: Provide a textual summary of the key insights from the analysis, highlighting statistically significant correlations and potential causal relationships. 
- Download Report: Enable users to download a report containing the data analysis results and visualizations (e.g., PDF, HTML).
- Data Security: Ensure complete data privacy. All processing occurs client-side, with no data stored or transmitted.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4B0082), suggesting intellect and data-driven insights.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF), providing a clean, non-distracting canvas.
- Accent color: Deep orange (#FF8C00), to draw attention to insights and CTAs. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent data concepts and tools.
- A clean, grid-based layout will be used to organize the UI. Data inputs and visualization output will have separate clear panes in the application.
- Subtle transitions when switching between different analysis modes or visualizations.
